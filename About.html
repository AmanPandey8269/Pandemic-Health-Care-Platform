            <h1> Our Vision </h1>

            <p>
              Our goal is to help as much people as we can during the time of any emergency or any other Pandemic. We saw what happened during Covid-19, many people suffered due to lack of resources and many casualties occurred. So we decieded to take a step forward and build a platform where people can get all the help they need during times like those be it <strong>Searching for Hospitals Nearby</strong> or get <strong>Medicines delivered at there home</strong> and many more things. We wanted to get ready for anything that comes next and the start of it was by making this website.</p>

            <h1> About the Developers </h1>

            <p>
              The minds behind this website are of Aman Pandey, Vishal Jain, Shivam Shivhare and Saurabh Kushwah.

              They got the idea for making this website during the Corona pendamic. At that time many people were not able to get necessities like blood, oxygen cylinder and so on. They had to look everywhere so hard for getting these all things. They decided to create a all in one website where people could find all the necessary things at a single place. This is how the idea of this website was born and took form with the help of RGPV hackathon.
